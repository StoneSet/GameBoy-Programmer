# GameBoy-Programmer
The USB gameboy Programmer (In build)


## This project is a redesign of the already existing project available at this address:

** http://reinerziegler.de/readplus.htm#GB_Flasher **

1. There are two versions (USB and RS232), the one I reproduced is the USB version.

2. I have no rights to the "Reinerziegler" project, I just make the PCB design accessible to everyone. There are two versions of this project (Fritzing and Altium 2017)

I took the schemas as the proposed site, to redo them in professional software to allow the creation of a PCB prototyping more simply.
